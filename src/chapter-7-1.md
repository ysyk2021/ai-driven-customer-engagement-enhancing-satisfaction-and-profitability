As businesses increasingly incorporate AI technology into their customer engagement strategies, it is essential to ensure that ethical and unbiased practices are maintained. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of managing ethics and bias in AI-enabled customer engagement.

Understanding Ethics and Bias in AI

Ethics refers to a set of moral principles that govern behavior, while bias refers to the presence of systematic errors in data or algorithms that can result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups.

In the context of AI-enabled customer engagement, ethics involves ensuring that customer data is collected and used in a responsible manner, and that AI algorithms are designed and deployed in ways that do not violate privacy or discriminate against individuals or groups. Bias in AI can arise from several sources, including biased training data, design decisions, and algorithmic decision-making processes.
